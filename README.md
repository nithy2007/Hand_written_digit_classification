Digit Classification

This project performs multiclass digit classification using a dataset of handwritten digits (pendigits.tra and pendigits.tes).
Multiple machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting are applied and compared— to analyze their performance and generalization ability.
